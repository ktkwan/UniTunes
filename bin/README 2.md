**Team Strengths and Weaknesses:** _Fill this in!_

**Project Idea(s):** _Fill this in with three unique ideas! (Due by March 2)_
### Idea 1 Brown Spotify
Approved

Problem to solve: 
Student’s currently have little exposure to the student audio(music, podcasts, dj set) creators on campus. Furthermore, student creators don’t have a platform to share their work with other students in a way that will garner their work the attention that they deserve. 

Algorithm: We were thinking of implementing the Collaborative Filtering algorithm which is reliant on user feedback where it uses streaming counts and user visits to artists' pages. It is essentially an algorithm used for recommendation where it makes song/artist recommendations for users based on their connection with other users. The data used for recommendations is stored in user vectors that store a listeners music preferences and song vectors that store a song's music profile. These vectors are then compared with each other in order to recommend songs to users. We can use this algorithm to recommend users with different artists at Brown!

Requirements: 
Users are very interested in learning more about student musicians on campus. Thus, we need to create a platform that is user friendly for both the content creators and the student listener. We should be able to upload different forms of audio in order to present creators with a platform to share their work. The audio should be displayed on the website, so that students on campus would have greater access and exposure to it, because currently students are gaining exposure to new music through concert attendance and friend recommendations. There should also be some sort of filtering/record keeping for the audio that is inputted, so that the website would be easier to use, and the work of the student artists could be highlighted. Lastly, users should be able to interact with the audio in order to garner more user engagement, because the survey indicated a high interest in what types of music one’s peers were creating and listening to. 

Potential Roadblocks: 
There will have to be two different types of interfaces for the two different user profiles that we will have: the audio creator, and the student listener. Furthermore, later we will have to determine a mechanism for filtering the media on our platform. For a user friendly platform, we will also need to think of modes of garnering user involvement such as keeping track of likes, etc. 

User Perspective: 
We created a google form with a few interview questions that we gave to students at Brown, because our target demographic is Brown University students. From survey results, all interviewed participants said that they are interested in learning more about student musicians on campus. The majority of users said that they discover new music through friends recommendations, going to concerts, and through spotify while a minority said they discovered new music through Youtube and Soundcloud. From a scale of 1-5, the majority of users said that how easy it is to access student produced audio is a 2. The people who said that they do create content said that they are maybe empowered to share their work, and they are doing so through social media and soundcloud. 

### Idea 2 Resource hub for creative work 
_Rejected for the same reason_

Problem to solve: 
There are a lot of skilled workers on both RISD and Brown campuses. There is a lot of need for freelance work, and temporary labor among student organizations. Furthermore, there are equally many students seeking quick jobs to make a buck. 

Requirements: 
Users are interested in a platform where Brown/RISD students with a specific skill can assist you with a project/task. Thus, our interface needs to deal with two different user needs once again. One for the ones seeking the job, and those that are posting the jobs. Furthermore, we also need a way of storing and cataloging all the postings, and to verify the quality of the content.  This is so that students seeking jobs can easily find work that suits their needs, and also so that the ones posting jobs could find viable workers for their jobs. Additionally we should have a filtering system to sort by the relevance of the work posted.

Potential Roadblocks: 
It could be tricky to create a system of filters that makes it so that the relevant job postings for each individual job seeker can be displayed. 

User Perspective: 
Once again, we created a google form that we passed among Brown University students. We posed questions such as, “Have you ever wanted to find a Brown/RISD student with a specific skill to assist you with a project/task?” and “If there were a platform where Brown/RISD students could contract other students to help with projects, would you use it?” The majority of the users surveyed said that if such a platform existed that they would use it. However, not that many people answered yes to the first question. 


### Idea 3 Brown housing guide 
_Rejected for the same reason_

Problem to solve: 
Currently, there seems to be a lack of resources regarding on campus housing options. Most of the information regarding housing currently travels through word of mouth. Thus, we thought it would be helpful to create an information hub for housing recommendations based on student reviews. In particular, resources regarding accessibility, and accommodations are very scarce.

Requirements: 
We need to have a sufficient database for all the user reviews for each individual dorm because the user survey indicated that a lot of the current information regarding housing is obtained through word of mouth. It seems like peer advice is one of the most reliable sources of housing information. Thsu,  we would need a way of creating and distributing these housing surveys. The website needs to be dynamic such that new dorm options can be added, and reviews can constantly be updated, because housing options are also changing. Lastly, there needs to be certain filter options such that if a user wants to search for a particular criteria, they are able to find the houses that meet that criteria because different users seem to prioritize different criteria differently such as location, quietness, amenities, etc. 

Potential Roadblocks: 
The major roadblock would be to collect sufficient data and information. Furthermore, we don’t know how much accessibility information is currently published. 

User Perspective: 
We once again used a Google Form that we presented to our peers. We asked questions such as, “Have you ever wanted to find out more about the on campus housing options?” and “What is the main factor that helped you determine where you wanted to live on campus?” The majority of those surveyed said that they did want to find out more about housing options and that the main factors for determining where they lived on campus were nice facilities and how central the dorm was located. We can then use such criteria when presenting filtering options to the user.  

### Strengths and Weaknesses: 
Ambika: 
Strengths: 
Understand the music/art/media community well if we go for either the spotify or resource hub idea & thinking about different types of user needs 
Experience with 3d modelling/animation in maya and unity 
Weaknesses: 
Need a longer timeline to work, can’t do everything at once 
Gets over excited about many different ideas, difficult to focus on one at a time 

Katie: 
Strengths: 
I have some mobile development experience (Objective-C)
I am more of a front-end developer, I like designing 
I have some prior React knowledge
Weaknesses:
Work better in longer periods of time, need breaks 
Need a plan to get started

Rebecca:
Strengths :) -
Ideas/theory and big picture design. 
Good at making plans. 
I prefer back end and algorithms. 
Engish. 
Weaknesses :( - 
I’m not very detail oriented. 
Sometimes not the most patient with coding. 
Not a sprinter, need breaks in between work.  

Rachel: 
Strengths :) -
Have friends at RISD to get input from 
Some experience with other map software (GIS)
Weaknesses :( -
I have a hard time getting started but also work better when I start early so I don’t get stressed about it
